# contrast-colorblind-colorpicker
A color picker designed to allow web/graphic designers and front-end dev to "feel out" the contrast and colorblind issues better than most accessibility validators. Contrast mode provides a visual display of the failure range of values. Colorblind filters allow the user to see/compare the color spectrums of 8 forms of colorblindness to ordinary vision. Color is presented both as a swatch and as a visual display of font versus background.
